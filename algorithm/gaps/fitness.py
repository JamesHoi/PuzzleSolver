    The dissimilarity measure relies on the premise that adjacent jigsaw pieces in the original image tend to share
    similar colors along their abutting edges, i.e., the sum (over all neighboring pixels) of squared color differences
    (over all three color bands) should be minimal. Let pieces pi , pj be represented in normalized L*a*b*
    space by corresponding W x W x 3 matrices, where W is the height/width of each piece (in pixels).
